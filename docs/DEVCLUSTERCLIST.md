  - [x] Configure port forwarding
    ```bash
    # Port forwards managed through script:
    ./dev-cluster/scripts/manage-port-forwards.sh
    
    # Required SSH port forwards from local machine:
    ssh -L 3001:localhost:3001 -L 30686:localhost:30686 -L 8081:localhost:8081 opsramp@198.18.5.150

    - Frontend UI: http://localhost:8081
  - [x] Configure with existing collector
    ```bash
    # Successfully configured OpenTelemetry Demo to send traces to external Jaeger
    # Key configuration:
    helm install otel-demo open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo \
      --namespace otel-demo \
      --create-namespace \
      --set default.replicas=1 \
      --set serviceAccount.create=true \
      --set opentelemetry-collector.config.exporters.jaeger.endpoint=jaeger-collector.observability:14250

    # Important Notes:
    # 1. Using Jaeger native protocol (port 14250) instead of OTLP (4317)
    # 2. Correct service namespace in endpoint (jaeger-collector.observability)
    # 3. Frontend-proxy used for UI access instead of direct frontend service
    ```
  - [x] Validate telemetry data flow
    - [x] Traces visible in Jaeger UI
    - [x] Frontend-proxy properly forwarding traffic
    - [x] All 24 pods running and healthy
  ```bash
  # Status: Fully operational
  # Components verified:
  - Frontend and UI components (Running)
  - Frontend-proxy configured and accessible
  - Backend services (Running)
  - Telemetry components (Running)
  - Load generator (Running)
  - Trace flow to Jaeger confirmed
  
  # Services verified:

  - OpenTelemetry Collector (Sending traces to Jaeger)
  - Microservices (accounting, cart, checkout, etc.)
  - Supporting services (kafka, redis, etc.)

  # Location: dev-cluster/scripts/manage-port-forwards.sh
  # Manages port forwards for:
  - Grafana (3001:80)
  - Jaeger (30686:16686)
  - Frontend-proxy (8081:8080)
  
  # Features:
  - Automatic cleanup of existing port forwards
  - Health checks for service accessibility
  - Support for both pod and service forwards
  - Clear status reporting
  ```

### Lessons Learned

   - Use Jaeger native protocol (14250) for trace export
   - Properly reference service names with namespace
   - Configure collector through Helm values
2. Port Forwarding
   - Use frontend-proxy instead of frontend service
   - Manage both local and SSH port forwards
   - Centralize port forward management in script
3. Troubleshooting
   - Check pod logs for configuration issues
   - Verify service endpoints and protocols
   - Use proper namespace references
